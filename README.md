# G10 Arabic number
come with me and have a deep dive in how arabic numbers work
note: this doesn't mean you will learn arabic please use other
sources or learn it yourself this is my way of how i understand it
~*I am suffering*~
## usage
index.py is used when you have python installed but there is a exe alternative,
if a alpha numeric is found the program exits, if your unfortunately on mac
then you can practice on (lexisrex)[https://www.lexisrex.com/Arabic-Numbers/1-1000]
## How to help
you can help finding irregularities
## other
- Notes
 - should you download python?
  - no, unless you'd want to see index.py
 - why there is no mac application
  - it's too much work and I don't have a mac sdk
