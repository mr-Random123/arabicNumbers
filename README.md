# G10 Arabic number
come with me and have a deep dive in how arabic numbers work<br/>
note: this doesn't mean you will learn arabic please use other<br/>
sources or learn it yourself this is my way of how i understand it<br/>
~*I am suffering*~<br/>
## usage
download releases: https://github.com/mr-Random123/arabicNumbers/releases <br/>
index.py is used when you have python installed but there is a exe alternative,<br/>
if a alpha numeric is found the program exits, if your unfortunately on mac<br/>
then you can practice on [lexisrex](https://www.lexisrex.com/Arabic-Numbers/1-1000)<br/>
it only can reach up to 999999 the millionth place is incomplete<br/>
## How to help
you can help finding irregularities<br/>

- Notes
 - should you download python?<br/>
no, unless you'd want to see how index.py<br/>
 - why there is no mac application<br/>
it's too much work and I don't have a mac sdk <br/>
 - why can't they choose a modern programming language?<br/>
because of a few reasons <br/>
1st the command line<br/>
the important part of programming is the command line.<br/>
it used for running scripts doing minor changes without the use of the mouse<br/>
the mouse is considered a waste of time<br/>
2nd dealing with a external library<br/>
in python you got tkinter but you don't get to experience<br/>
of a simple gui like vb6.  <br/>
3rd vb6 is actually more easier than python ~*(only in gui)*~<br/>
python is indentation sensitive meaning this "   " *- indentation*<br/>
yes python is beginner friendly, but it doesn't teach you how to make<br/>
a gui like vb6.
