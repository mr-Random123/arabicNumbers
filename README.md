# G10 Arabic number
come with me and have a deep dive in how arabic numbers work
note: this doesn't mean you will learn arabic please use other
sources or learn it yourself this is my way of how i understand it
~*I am suffering*~
## usage
index.py is used when you have python installed but there is a exe alternative,
if a alpha numeric is found the program exits, if your unfortunately on mac
then you can practice on [lexisrex](https://www.lexisrex.com/Arabic-Numbers/1-1000)
it only can reach up to 999999 the millionth place is incomplete

- Notes
 - should you download python?
no, unless you'd want to see how index.py
 - why there is no mac application
it's too much work and I don't have a mac sdk 
 - why can't they choose a modern programming language?
because of a few reasons 
1st the command line
the important part of programming is the command line.
it used for running scripts doing minor changes without the use of the mouse
the mouse is considered a waste of time
2nd dealing with a external library
in python you got tkinter but you don't get to experience
of a simple gui like vb6.  
3rd vb6 is actually more easier than python ~*(only in gui)*~
python is indentation sensitive meaning this "   " *- indentation*
yes python is beginner friendly, but it doesn't teach you how to make
a gui like vb6.
